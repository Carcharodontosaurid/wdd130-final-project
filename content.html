                Welcome To the Exciting World of Professional Yoyo!
            </h2>
            <p>
                Do you remember that time when you were a kid and some guy came to your elemntary school and did a bunch
                of
                wild
                yoyo tricks for an assembly, and it was pretty much the <em>coolest</em> thing you had ever seen (or
                at least seen at school)? We'd bet that almost every kid in your school had their own yoyo and was
                'walking the dog' down the hall within the week. We'd also bet that almost every one of those yoyos
                disappeared a week later, and with them went everyone's dreams of being as good as Dan the Yoyo Man.
                Here at Infinite Triangle, our goal is to restore that same sense of wonder and excitement you had
                after that assembly, and give you the tools to succeed at becoming the <strong>best</strong> player you
                can be.

                Just like a caricature artist or web designer, each yoyo player has their own specific
                flare. Whether you like dizzying speed combos, mind-bending slack tricks, or off-axis finger
                grinds, there's a yoyo for you!

            <p>Did you know there is more than one style of yoyo? Some are probably more familiar
                to you (such as responsive and looping), and others may be more suprising (like 3A or Freehand).
                But we're here to walk you through each one to find your perfect style.</p>

            <h3 class="header-styles" id="1a-header">1a (Looping)</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-styles" id="1a-paragraph">
                This is probably what most people think of when they think of yoyo. This is the most common and
            most versitile style on this list. Most tricks involve loops and landing the yoyo back on sections
            of string and 'hopping' them between different configurations. Some of these are done to make pictures
            of the string, aptly named "picture tricks." Rock the Baby and Eiffiel tower are great examples of these.
