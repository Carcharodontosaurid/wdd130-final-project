          Welcome To the Exciting World of Professional Yoyo!
        </h2>
        <p>
          Do you remember that time when you were a kid and some guy came to
          your elemntary school and did a bunch of wild yoyo tricks for an
          assembly, and it was pretty much the <em>coolest</em> thing you had
          ever seen (or at least seen at school)? We'd bet that almost every kid
          in your school had their own yoyo and was 'walking the dog' down the
          hall within the week. We'd also bet that almost every one of those
          yoyos disappeared a week later, and with them went everyone's dreams
          of being as good as Dan the Yoyo Man. Here at Infinite Triangle, our
          goal is to restore that same sense of wonder and excitement you had
          after that assembly, and give you the tools to succeed at becoming the
          <strong>best</strong> player you can be.

          Just like a caricature artist or web designer, each yoyo player has
          their own specific flare. Whether you like dizzying speed combos,
          mind-bending slack tricks, or off-axis finger grinds, there's a yoyo
          for you!
