        Did you know there is more than one style of yoyo? Some are probably
        more familiar to you (such as responsive and looping), and others may
        be more suprising (like 3A or Freehand). But we're here to walk you
        through each one to find your perfect style.

      <h3 class="header-styles" id="1a-header">1a (Looping)</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-styles" id="1a-paragraph">
        This is probably what most people think of when they think of yoyo.
        This is the most common and most versitile style on this list. Most
        tricks involve loops and landing the yoyo back on sections of string
        and 'hopping' them between different configurations. Some of these are
        done to make pictures of the string, aptly named "picture tricks."
        Rock the Baby and Eiffiel tower are great examples of these.

      <p class="paragraph-styles" id="2a-paragraph">
        In 2a, each hand has a yoyo connected to it and performs it's own
        tricks and loops. While it can be a very challenging style to learn,
        it is also one of the most impressive and awe-inspiring.

      <h3 class="header-styles" id="3a-header">3a (Two Handed)</h3>
      <p class="paragraph-styles" id="3a-paragraph">
        Like 2a, in 3a each hand has a yoyo connected to it. But here the two
        yoyos interact with each other to perform far more complex, and by
        extention, incredible tricks. Also like 2a, it is both a difficult and
        rewarding style to learn.

        <p class="paragraph-styles" id="4a-paragraph">
        4a, or "Offstring", is a style of yoyoing where the string is not
        connected to the yoyo at all. As you can probably guess, this allows
        for some very unique tricks and techniques that can only be
        accomplished in 4a. It's actually one of the easier styles to learn,
        and can be a viable option for a beginner to start their journey.

        <h3 class="header-styles" id="5a-header">5a (Freehand)</h3>
        <p class="paragraph-styles" id="5a-paragraph">
          5a, or "Freehand", is a relatively newer style that was developed in 1999 by Steve Brown and gaining significant popularity
          during the mid - late 2000's. In this style the string is not tied around the player's finger, but a counterweight instead.
          This allows for far more advanced and flamboyant tricks, but is also significantly more difficult as the player now has two
          objects to keep track of and no point of connection to either.
